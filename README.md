Single-molecule assay for DNA loop extrusion by SMC. Kymograph and kinetics from the loop assays.

## Project Details



## Installation

It's best to use an isolated environment for this program. But it might just work with your standard/base environment if it has python>=3.7.

You can install the LEADS module by

```sh
pip3 install manimlib
```

## Usage

To open the gui of kymograph analysis
> python -m leads.gui.kymograph_gui

To open the gui for cropping large files in a folder
> python -m leads.gui.crop_images_gui
